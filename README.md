##About scraping_for_fun.python
This python code is a collection of some of my learnings .

## Learning 1
Learning 1 corresponds to fetching information using a weather API.
urllib and requests are one of the most used python libraries for similar purposes.
and then we save the file into a json document using json dumps function.
for more information about json inbuit function feel free to email me @eshikamahajan21@gmail.com

## Learning 2
In Learning 2, I fetched the address from the google maps API.
To get the search key, you need to register yourself on the goole server.
To find any address replace the 'your address here' with the desired address.

## Learning 3
Learning 3 is used to scrap the facebook's profile picture corresponding to FB Token ids.
